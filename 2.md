tell me all the rules of calculus

Calculus has many rules and formulas, but here are some of the most important ones:

    The Sum Rule: If f(x) and g(x) are two differentiable functions, then their sum, h(x) = f(x) + g(x), is also differentiable and the derivative is given by the formula: h'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x).

    The Product Rule: If f(x) and g(x) are two differentiable functions, then their product, h(x) = f(x)g(x), is also differentiable and the derivative is given by the formula: h'(x) = f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x).

    The Quotient Rule: If f(x) and g(x) are two differentiable functions, then their quotient, h(x) = f(x)/g(x), is also differentiable if g(x) is not equal to zero and the derivative is given by the formula: h'(x) = (g(x)f'(x) - f(x)g'(x))/g^2(x).

    The Chain Rule: If f(x) and g(x) are two differentiable functions, then the composite function h(x) = f(g(x)) is also differentiable and the derivative is given by the formula: h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x).

    The Power Rule: If n is a constant, then the derivative of x^n is given by the formula: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1).

    The Exponential Rule: If a is a constant, then the derivative of e^ax is given by the formula: d/dx(e^ax) = ae^ax.

    The Logarithm Rule: If a and b are constants, then the derivative of ln(ax^b) is given by the formula: d/dx(ln(ax^b)) = b/x.

    The Trigonometric Rules: If f(x) = sin(x), g(x) = cos(x), h(x) = tan(x), i(x) = cot(x), j(x) = sec(x), k(x) = csc(x) are all differentiable functions, then the derivatives are given by the formulas:

    d/dx(sin(x)) = cos(x)
    d/dx(cos(x)) = -sin(x)
    d/dx(tan(x)) = sec^2(x)
    d/dx(cot(x)) = -csc^2(x)
    d/dx(sec(x)) = sec(x)tan(x)
    d/dx(csc(x)) = -csc(x)cot(x)

These are just a few of the many rules and formulas in calculus. It's also important to note that many of these formulas have multiple variations and extensions depending on the specific problem or situation. And also it's important to practice solving problems and understanding the concepts behind the formulas.
